### Project Overview
[AITRIOS](https://www.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/) is an innovative solution from [Sony Semiconductor](https://www.sony-semicon.com/index.html) that leverages Edge Vision AI, IoT, and Cloud technologies to build a revolutionary ecosystem centered around Sony cameras.

### Key Responsibilities
As the sole Staff Cloud Engineer for Sony Semiconductor in China, my primary responsibilities included:
#### 1. System Integration
- Introduced the [AITRIOS](https://www.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/) solution from Japan to China:
  - Migrated the solution from Azure Global to Azure China (operated by 21Vianet), addressing technical, compliance, security, and service availability challenges.
  - Collaborated with hardware and embedded teams to integrate cameras, motherboards (Raspberry Pi, custom versions), ESP32, and embedded software (FreeRTOS, Nuttx) into Azure China.

#### 2. Global Development
- **Frontend**: Led the Chinese team in refactoring the legacy Pro UI with Angular 16 and upgraded it to Angular 18.
- **Testing**: Established a frontend testing framework using Playwright.
- **Backend**: Redesigned the backend architecture with an abstraction layer to support multi-cloud compatibility (Alibaba Cloud, private cloud) alongside Azure services (Azure Functions, IoT Hub, CosmosDB, etc.).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Transitioned from ARM templates to Python, Ansible, and Terraform for multi-cloud deployment automation.
- Replaced Azure IoT Hub with ThingsBoard and performed customizations.

#### 3. Localization
- Gathered requirements from Chinese clients and translated them into technical specifications for global teams.
- Developed PoC systems tailored to local needs.
- Built a cloud resource management system using Django + Celery + Vue and IaC tools to reduce cloud costs by 40% in Azure China.

#### 4. Project Management
- Aligned milestones with global teams and ensured on-time delivery in China.
- Managed outsourcing teams, defined KPIs, and oversaw technical direction.

### Achievements
- Successfully localized the [AITRIOS](https://www.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/) project in China.
- Transformed the China team from an operations-focused group into a core development team.
- Received annual commendations from global leadership.
